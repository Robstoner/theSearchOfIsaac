# The Search of Isaac - An Arduino game based on The Binding of Isaac

## Description

This game is made as a project for the Introduction to Robotics course at UB-FMI. It is based on the game The Binding of Isaac, on a 8x8 LED matrix and a 16x2 LCD display. The twist of the game is that instead of enemies, the player has to find treasures while avoiding obstacles. There are multiple rooms, with multiple treasures, and the player has to find as many as they can before the time runs out. They also need to find the exit before the time runs out and escape, so being greedy can be dangerous.
